Android Team Code Challenge
<br>To successfully complete this challenge, you must build a working Android video gallery and
player application that fulfills the following requirements
<br>● Code should be well-structured and reasonably documented
<br>● Code should implement the required features and does not have major defects
<br>● Open-source libraries are permitted
<br>● Either fetch and parse video manifest file(located at https://bit.ly/2MIjM4F), or package
the file with your app. However if you choose to package this file into the Android project,
then the offline playing becomes mandatory
<br>● Display the contents of the manifest in a clickable gallery,
where each entry is comprised of a video thumbnail and title
<br>● In portrait mode, display a selected video above the gallery,
i.e. YouTube in portrait mode
<br>● In landscape mode, videos must play fullscreen
<br>● Video playback position must be maintained through orientation changes
<br>● The next video in the list should auto-play after first user selection completes
<br>● Bonus: Videos can play offline(however if you choose to package the json file, then this
feature is mandatory)
<br>● Bonus: Each gallery entry displays video duration alongside title and thumbnail
<br>● Bonus: Write an instrumentation test for part of the app
